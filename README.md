The Bot: https://twitter.com/BotTeiro

A Twitter Bot that retweets news from around the world and provides a daily quote. If he is on the mood you could even get a reponse from him!

## Built With

- Ruby

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

Go to https://github.com/srizzuto/Twitter_Bot

1. Click on the code and copy the HTML code.
2. Use terminal to clone this repository on your local machine.
3. Run <code>git checkout -b your-branch-name</code>. Make your contributions.
4. Push your branch up to your forked repository.
5. Open a Pull Request with a detailed description of the development branch of the original project for a review.

## Running tests

To run the rspec tests locally :

1) If you want a specific block:
    - On terminal <code>rspec ./spec/spec_mentions_ans.rb</code>, <code>rspec ./spec/spec_quotes.rb</code>, <code>rspec ./spec/spec_teirobot.rb</code> or <code>rspec ./spec/spec_news_retweet.rb</code>

2) If you want to execute all at once
    - On terminal <code>ruby ./spec/spec_run_all.rb</code>

## Instructions

1) Open your terminal:
    - On Windows => <code>Win + R</code>
    - On Linux => <code>ctrl + alt + T</code>
    - On Mac => <code>Control + Option + Shift + T</code>

2) To get access to the bot you will need API Keys. To require them you can reach me on <a href="https://microverse-students.slack.com/team/U01QKHGNZLZ">Slack</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sbstnrzzt">Twitter</a> or <a href="https://github.com/srizzuto">GitHub</a>

3) In the directory where the bot is located, it will be the one where you cloned the repository. Execute the main.rb by typing:
    - <code>bin/main.rb</code>

4) Alright! The bot (https://twitter.com/BotTeiro) is already on, unless you modified the parameters it will do three different things every five minutes:

      - It will retweet a notice for each tag passed as parameter (in this case, world news).
      - It will post a quote (it has over 100 famous quotes stored!).
      - If the bot is mentioned, before doing retweets and post the quote it will take the last mention and answer to it.

5) Whenever you want to terminate the program, use <code>ctrl + C</code> to finish the program.

Have fun!
